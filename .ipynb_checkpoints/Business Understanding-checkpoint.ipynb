    "Thousands of traffic accidents occur in the city of Seattle every year, some of which result in fatalities. The goal of this project is to examine recent traffic collision data and try to predict the severity of any given traffic accident with the intention of making useful recommendations to the city council in hopes that they will implement effective policies like road taxes with the intention of reducing the number of severe traffic accidents."
